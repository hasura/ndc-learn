# Let's Build a Connector - Part 1 - Setup

In this tutorial series we'll be building a native data connector for Hasura in small steps. Data connectors allow us to target arbitrary data sources and bring their data into our Hasura graph.

If you're not familiar with Native Data Connectors, I would suggest that you review the NDC specification briefly first, and then come back to read these tutorials.

In this first tutorial, I'll set up the scaffolding for our connector, and we'll see the first queries start to work. We'll also start to develop a test suite, and see our connector running in Hasura.

For now, we'll just handle the most basic queries, but in some later tutorials, we'll start to fill in some of the gaps in our implementation, and see more queries return results correctly. We'll also cover topics such as metrics, connector configuration, error reporting, and tracing.

The data source we'll be targeting is a local sqlite database, and we'll be using the Hasura TypeScript connector SDK.

Here I have an empty TypeScript project, and I've added the SDK as a dependency along with the sqlite library and its TypeScript bindings.

Let's start by following the SDK guidelines and using the `start` function.

```typescript
const connector: Connector<Configuration, State> = {};

start(connector);
```

We need to fill in implementations for each of the required functions, but we won't need all of these to work just yet.

First, you'll see that we define two types: `Configuration`, and `State`.

Let's define those now.

```typescript
type Configuration = {
  tables: TableConfiguration[];
};

type TableConfiguration = {
  tableName: string;
  columns: { [k: string]: Column };
};

type Column = {};

type State = {
  db: Database;
};
```

`Configuration` is the type of the connector's configuration, which will be read from a directory on disk. By convention, this configuration should be enough to reproducibly determine the NDC schema, so for our sqlite connector, we 
configure the connector with a list of tables that we want to expose. Each table is defined by its name and a list of columns. Columns don't have any specific configuration yet, but we leave an empty object type here because we might want to capture things like column types later on.

The `State` type is for things like connection pools, handles, or any non-serializable state that gets allocated on startup, and which lives for the lifetime of the connector. For our connector, we need to keep a handle to our sqlite database.

Now let's fill in some function definitions.

```typescript
async function parseConfiguration(configurationDir: string): Promise<Configuration> {
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

async function fetchMetrics(configuration: RawConfiguration, state: State): Promise<undefined> {
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

async function healthCheck(configuration: RawConfiguration, state: State): Promise<undefined> {
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

async function explain(configuration: RawConfiguration, state: State, request: QueryRequest): Promise<ExplainResponse> {
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

async function mutation(configuration: RawConfiguration, state: State, request: MutationRequest): Promise<MutationResponse> {
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

async function tryInitState(configuration: RawConfiguration, metrics: unknown): Promise<State> {
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

function getCapabilities(configuration: RawConfiguration): CapabilitiesResponse {\
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

async function getSchema(configuration: RawConfiguration): Promise<SchemaResponse> {
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

async function query(configuration: RawConfiguration, state: State, request: QueryRequest): Promise<QueryResponse> {
  throw new Error("Function not implemented.");
}

const connector: Connector<Configuration, State> = {
  parseConfiguration,
  tryInitState,
  fetchMetrics,
  healthCheck,
  getCapabilities,
  getSchema,
  queryExplain,
  mutationExplain,
  mutation,
  query
};
```

Right now, we only need to implement five functions: `parseConfiguration`, which reads the configuration from files on disk; `tryInitState`, which initializes our database connection; `getCapabilities`,
which returns the NDC capabilities of our connector; `getSchema`, which returns an NDC schema containing our tables and columns; and `query`, which actually responds to query requests.

We'll skip configuration validation entirely for now, and just read the raw configuration from a `configuration.json` file in the configuration directory:

```ts
const configuration_file = resolve(configurationDir, 'configuration.json');
const configuration_data = await readFile(configuration_file);
const configuration = JSON.parse(configuration_data.toString());
return {
    filename: resolve(configurationDir, 'database.db'),
    ...configuration
};
```

To initialize our state in the `tryInitState` function, we'll use the `open` function to open a connection to the database, and store the resulting connection object in our connector state:

```typescript
const db = await open({
  filename: configuration.filename,
  driver: sqlite3.Database
});

return { db };
```

Our capabilities response will be very simple, because we won't support many capabilities yet.

```typescript
return {
  version: "0.1.2",
  capabilities: {
    query: {},
    mutation: {}
  }
}
```

We just return the version of the specification that we are compatible with, and the basic `query` and `mutation` capabilities.

`getSchema` is the first interesting function. We're going to define scalar types, and an object type and a collection for each table in the configuration.
Let's first define the scalar types. In fact, we're only going to define one, called `any`:

```typescript
let scalar_types: { [k: string]: ScalarType } = {
  'any': {
    aggregate_functions: {},
    comparison_operators: {
      'eq': {
        type: 'equal'
      }
    },
  }
};
```

`any` is a generic scalar type that we'll use as the type of all of our columns. It doesn't have any aggregates defined, and only a single equality comparison operator, `eq`. Later, when we talk about those features, we'll need to 
split this type up into several different scalar types.

Now let's define the object types.

```typescript
let object_types: { [k: string]: ObjectType } = {};

for (const table of configuration.tables) {
  let fields: { [k: string]: ObjectField } = {};

  for (const columnName in table.columns) {
    fields[columnName] = {
      type: {
        type: 'named',
        name: 'any'
      }
    };
  }

  object_types[table.tableName] = {
    fields
  };
}
```

Here we create one `ObjectType` definition for each table in the configuration. 

Notice that the name of the object type is the name of the table, and each column uses the `any` type that we just defined.

Now let's define the collections:

```typescript
let collections: CollectionInfo[] = configuration.tables.map((table) => {
  return {
    arguments: {},
    name: table.tableName,
    deletable: false,
    foreign_keys: {},
    uniqueness_constraints: {},
    type: table.tableName,
  };
});
```

Again, we define one collection per table in the configuration, and we use the object type with the same name that we just defined.

Now we can put the schema response together:

```typescript
return {
  functions: [],
  procedures: [],
  collections,
  object_types,
  scalar_types,
};
```

Notice that we don't define `functions` or `procedures`, but we'll cover those features later.

We have one more function to define, namely the `query` function, but before we do, let's talk about tests. The NDC specification repository provides a test runner executable called `ndc-test`, which can be used to implement a test suite for a connector. We can also use `ndc-test` to run some automatic tests and validate the work we've done so far. 

Let's compile and run our connector, and then use the test runner with the running connector.

First let's run the connector, specifying a configuration directory containing a working `configuration.json` file:

```sh
npm run build && node dist/index.js serve --configuration .
```

Now, let's run the tests.

```sh
ndc-test --endpoint http://localhost:8080/

├ Capabilities ...
│ ├ Fetching /capabilities ... OK
│ ├ Validating capabilities ... OK
├ Schema ...
│ ├ Fetching schema ... OK
...
```

Of course, we expect them to fail, but we can already see that our schema response is good.

Let's modify our query function to print out the request it receives, and this will give us a goal to work towards.

```typescript
console.log(JSON.stringify(request, null, 2));
```

In the logs, we can see the request that was sent:

```json
{
  "collection": "artists",
  "query": {
    "aggregates": {},
    "limit": 10
  },
  "arguments": {},
  "collection_relationships": {}
}
```

It identifies the name of the collection, and a query object to run. The query has a list of fields to retrieve, and a limit of 10 rows. With this as a guide, we can start to implement our query function.

The query function is going to delegate to a function called `fetch_rows`, but only when rows are requested, which is indicated by the presence of the query fields property.

```typescript
const rows = request.query.fields && await fetch_rows(state, request);

return [{ rows }];
```

Later, we'll also implement aggregates here.

Let's fill in the `fetch_rows` function:

```typescript
async function fetch_rows(state: State, request: QueryRequest): Promise<{
  [k: string]: RowFieldValue
}[]> {
  const fields = [];

  for (const fieldName in request.query.fields) {
    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(request.query.fields, fieldName)) {
      const field = request.query.fields[fieldName];
      switch (field.type) {
        case 'column':
          fields.push(`${field.column} AS ${fieldName}`);
          break;
        case 'relationship':
          throw new Error("Relationships are not supported");
      }
    }
  }

  if (request.query.order_by != null) {
    throw new NotSupported("Sorting is not supported");
  }

  const limit_clause = request.query.limit == null ? "" : `LIMIT ${request.query.limit}`;
  const offset_clause = request.query.offset == null ? "" : `OFFSET ${request.query.offset}`;

  const sql = `SELECT ${fields.length ? fields.join(", ") : '1 AS __empty'} FROM ${request.collection} ${limit_clause} ${offset_clause}`;

  console.log(JSON.stringify({ sql }, null, 2));

  const rows = await state.db.all(sql, ...parameters);

  return rows.map((row) => { delete row.__empty; return row; });
}
```

This function breaks down the request that we saw earlier and produces some SQL with this basic shape here. The requested fields get pushed down in the target list here, and the limit and offset clauses are generated based on the request as well. Notice that we don't fetch more data than we need, either in terms of rows or columns. That's the benefit of connectors - we get to push down the query execution to the data sources themselves.

Now let's see it work in the test runner. We'll rebuild and restart the connector, and run the tests again:

```sh
 ndc-test test --endpoint http://localhost:8080

...
├ Query ...
│ ├ albums ...
│ │ ├ Simple queries ...
│ │ │ ├ Select top N ... OK
│ │ │ ├ Predicates ... OK
│ │ │ ├ Sorting ... FAIL
...
```

Of course we still see our tests fail, but now we've made some progress because the most basic tests are passing. If we look at the connector logs, we can see that we're now receiving some
more advanced queries which we're not handling yet, such as queries with predicates and orderings.

In fact, we can get the test runner to write these expectations out as snapshot files to disk by adding the `--snapshots-dir` argument.

```sh
ndc-test test --endpoint http://0.0.0.0:8100 --snapshots-dir snapshots
```

In the `snapshots` directory, we can build up a library of query requests and expected responses that can be replayed in order to make sure that our connector continues to exhibit the same behavior over time.

That's it for this tutorial. In the next one, we'll start to fill out some of the missing query functionality, beginning with where clauses.
